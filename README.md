# Flower-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
Classifying flowers into 5 different categories on the basis of deep learning model(s)

Taking insights and dataset from Kaggle, we are creating two different deep learning models in order to classify the data into different flower categories.
As shown in the .ipynb file, two separate models ahve been created with the aim of increasing the performance and reducing overfitting.

NOTE : It is recommended to use the code in a Kaggle notebook, rather than on Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
